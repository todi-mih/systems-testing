# Integration Testing 

## Overview

This lab is designed to help you practice **integration testing** using `pytest` and a real-world REST API: the [Pixegami TODO API](https://todo.pixegami.io/docs). You will test how various components of the system interact — such as the API endpoints, HTTP client, and backend database.

## Project Structure

1. `integration_tests.py`: A starter file where you will implement your own integration tests.

> No backend implementation is required — you will be testing directly against the public Pixegami API.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install python, pytest and requests
3. Run tests using:

```bash
pytest -v integration_tests.py
```
## Recommended Setup

-   python 3.10+ (or 3.8+)
-   pytest
-   requests
